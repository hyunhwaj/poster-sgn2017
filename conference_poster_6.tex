\section*{A Brief Introduction}

I, Hyun-Hwan has started majoring in Computer Science since 2003 and have got my B.S. degree in 2007. During the undergraduate program, I was an enthusiastic student for studying computational algorithms and got several awards from computer programming/algorithm competition like ACM-ICPC(ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest
) and Topcoder. 
In my M.S. between 2007 and 2009, I studied two topics on SNP genotype data analysis. The first topic was about developing an algorithm to detect high-order epistatic interaction and the second was about the application of a heuristic algorithm for imputation of SNP genotype data. I started my Ph.D. program in 2009 once I got the M.S. degree.
During the Ph.D. studies, I highly focused on the development of integrative network analysis framework for multiple omics data using information-theoretic measure. I have received the Ph.D. degree in computer science in August 2015 and started postdoctoral associate position of Dr. Zhandong Liu's lab at Baylor College of Medicine, and co-mentored by Dr. Huda Zoghbi, since September 2015. 
Until now, I have nine peer-reviewed publications in Bioinformatics field on various topics and have five system biology papers among the publications. 

I am working on the development of quantification and statistical analysis pipeline for high-throughput screening data from neurological disorder studies to identify primary genetic modifiers of pathogenic proteins of the neurological disorders. 
I am also studying on developing an integrative network algorithm to improve the identification of various sources. I expect this will help to increase the reliability of results from the pipeline and can detect novel modifier candidates, which are not identified primary analysis.
